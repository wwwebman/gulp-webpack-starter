# Contributing
[Questions and comments](https://gitter.im/gulp-webpack-starter/Lobby), [issues](https://github.com/wwwebman/gulp-webpack-starter/issues), [pull requests](https://github.com/wwwebman/gulp-webpack-starter/pulls) are all welcome.  
Let's create something cool together :raised_hand:

## Getting Started - right way

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit a Github issue for this Repo.
  * Clearly describe the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master, run `git checkout -b
    fix/my_awesome_change`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units. 
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format:
  * Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes.
  * Start the line with "Fix", "Add", "Change" instead of "Fixed", "Added", "Changed".
  * Capitalize the subject line.
* Push chages
* Create Pull Request
